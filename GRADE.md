Excellent — another really strong showing. Let me give you a professional-style review.
I'll be totally honest — you're showing very good progress already compared to Day 1.
Quick summary:

You built a proper module, not a hack in main.
Your class is clean and encapsulated.
Your public API is good (add(), getAverage()).
Your state is correct (you maintain the queue + running sum).
You used modern C++ correctly (std::optional, std::size_t).
You correctly handled the "no data yet" case.

Result is functionally correct.
Minor points of feedback:
Logic in add()

Your logic is correct and robust.
You handled both "window full" and "window not yet full" cases explicitly — clear and readable.

Correctly maintained runningTotal_ → avoids recomputing sum every time → O(1) average computation → excellent.
getAverage()

Using std::optional here is excellent — very clean API design.
You return the precomputed movingAverage_ → correct.
You handle empty queue → correct.
Code style

Variable names clear and readable.
Class name clear.
Methods small and focused → good.
Minor improvements (professional polish)

a) Your debug print in constructor:

std::cout << "[MovingAverageCalculator] created with window size: " << WindowSize << "\n";

    Minor nit: WindowSize is the parameter but your member is windowSize_.

    Consider just printing windowSize_ — that way no risk if param name changes.

b) Slight redundancy:

Your add() method has:

runningTotal_ = runningTotal_ + data;
q_.push(data);
movingAverage_ = runningTotal_ / q_.size();

This pattern is repeated in both branches → could be factored once at end of function.
But this is very minor — readability is fine as is.

c) Could consider initializing movingAverage_ in constructor to 0.0 for explicitness — not required, but clarity.
Performance and correctness

Correct O(1) behavior.
Correct correctness (tested against example).
You used a simple queue, not reinvented — correct choice.
You used precomputation, not recomputing sum → very professional.
Interviewer verdict:

    Professional engineering thinking: yes.

    Clean API: yes.

    Correctness: yes.

    Code readability: yes.

    Modularity: yes.

Final verdict:

A grade.
This is the kind of clean code an interviewer would be very happy to see.
You clearly learned from Day 1 already — this was faster, cleaner, and more professional.
Summary:

You’re making rapid progress.
Your modular thinking is clearly improving.
You are designing real components, not just functions.

If you had written this in a Snap AR / HFT round — this would be a strong yes assuming no bugs.
